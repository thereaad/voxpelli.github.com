2016 is in full swing and it's long overdue to take a look back at the past year and what happened then. This is the final part of this four part series of posts about 2015.

### tl;dr

The year started out at Bloglovin, but I later left and now I freelance. Throughout I built some cool stuff for both Bloglovin (push, better images, smarter feed) and the IndieWeb (publishing to Jekyll blogs from eg. iOS etc) and now I’m all occupied building cool stuff as a freelancer.

### A list of all new projects 2015
